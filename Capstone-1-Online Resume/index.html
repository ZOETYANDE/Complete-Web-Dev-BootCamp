                    <h3>Digital Forensic Projects</h3>
                    <p>
                        Data retrieval from smartphones and hard drives, encompassing deleted and encrypted
                        data recovery, involves specialized methodologies. Forensic tools are employed to extract
                        an extensive range of information from smartphones, including deleted files, messages,
                        media, and application data. Similarly, in hard drive analysis, sector-by-sector scans aim to
                        reconstruct lost files. Encryption decryption methods and software assist in accessing
                        encrypted data by either utilizing decryption keys or employing algorithms to crack
                        encryption. Throughout this process, a focus is maintained on identifying sensitive
                        information such as personal data or confidential documents, achieved through advanced
                        search algorithms and keyword scanning within the recovered data.

                    <h3>Penetration Testing Using virtual Labs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Utilizing various tools such as netdiscover to pinpoint active hosts within a network and
                        employing nmap to meticulously scan both hostnames and IP addresses for potential open
                        ports, service versions, and operating system details on each system. Following this,
                        leveraging msfconsole (Metasploit) and exploitDB to search for associated exploits linked
                        to these open ports. The objective is to gain administrative access to the system by
                        employing a diverse array of techniques and exploits.
